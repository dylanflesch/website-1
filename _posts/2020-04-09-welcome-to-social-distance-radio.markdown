This is a pop-up online radio stream. We're all stuck at home and would like to be less bored. Schedules will start to fall in place soon, and maybe we'll establish some regularity like, "tune in every weekday evening from 6-7pm to hear your fave programs". Maybe we'll put up a calendar on this site too. 

In the meantime, it's kind of a crap shoot. Maybe we're broadcasting, maybe not. 

Tune in here:
