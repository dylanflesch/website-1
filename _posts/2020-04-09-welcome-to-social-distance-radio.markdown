This is a pop-up online radio stream. We're all stuck at home and would like to connect with our friends. I'm thinking if folks wanted to sign up for a recurring weekly hour long program that'd be the best way to get things started. And if we wanted to use the same hour window each day for these recurring programs, like 6:00-7:00pm (Eastern), that'd make things easier to manage. We might say things like, "tune in every evening from 6-7pm to hear your fave programs". 

Maybe we'll put up a calendar on this site too once things start to fall in place. In the meantime, it's kind of a crap shoot. Maybe we're broadcasting, maybe not. 

Tune in here:
